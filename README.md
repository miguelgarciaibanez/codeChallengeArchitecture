### Challenge

Hi, here is the challenge: 

Using these two endpoints:
- https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list (returns a list of dog breeds)
- https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breedName}/images/random (returns the URL of an image of the selected breed)

You have to create an API with an endpoint to return breeds containing more than a given number of vocals in their breed name along with the URL of an image associated with this breed.

Feel free to implement this API as you please, but please use NodeJS.
